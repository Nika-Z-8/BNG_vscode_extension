## Requirements

To use the run and plot buttons the default terminal you are using needs to have [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) installed as well as [BioNetGen commmand line interface](https://github.com/ASinanSaglam/BNG_cli) installed (you can do so with 'pip install bionetgen'). Current required version of the CLI is 0.2.6. Please note that both of these tools are in active early development and is subject to sweeping changes.
